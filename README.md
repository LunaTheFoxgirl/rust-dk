# Rust?

_(Imagine that a terribly photoshopped Rust logo with Romkugler and Stægt flæsk med persillesovs infront of it, is positioned here)_

Aren't you _træt_ from writing Rust programs in English? Do you like saying "lort" a lot? Would you like to try something different, in an exotic and funny-sounding language? Would you want to bring some Danish touch to your programs?

Rust (Danish for Rust) is here to save your day, as it allows you to write Rust programs in Danish, using Danish keywords, Danish function names and Danish idioms.

You're don't feel at ease using only Danish words? Don't worry! Danish Rust is fully compatible with English-Rust, so you can mix both at your convenience.

Here's an example of what can be achieved with Rust:

By the way I'm not a Rust developer so if this crashes and burns immediately then I'm sorry.

## Support for regional languages

```rust
#[tillad(utilgængelig_kode)]
funktion sekundær() {
    lort!("Åh nej"); // for Danes all around the country
    møg!("Det går vel også"); // for those Danes who want to add a bit of country flair to it
    hovsa!("Det gik ikke så godt"); // in SFW contexts
}
```
## Hvorfor?
 * Hvorfor ikke? Hvor der er en vilje er der en vej.

## Bidrag

First of all, _mange tak_ for considering participating to this joke, the
Danish government will thank you later! Feel free to throw in a few identifiers
here and there, and open a pull-request against the `hoved` (Danish for
`main`) branch.
